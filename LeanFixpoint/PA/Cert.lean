  ## Certifying Predicate Abstraction — the `glue`/`bridge` (paper §5)

  After weakening reaches the greatest inductive fixpoint `A*`
  (`solveFixpoint`), the cut κ-mvars are assigned their witness λ's
  (`σ_{A*}`). This file builds the §5 `glue` term: a proof of the body
  `c[σ_{A*}]` in which every κ-head leaf `κ(x̄)` is discharged by an
  `And.intro` over per-survivor oracle proofs, and every κ-free leaf is left
  as a residual obligation (a query of `c′`).

  Structurally `walkPAProof` mirrors Zap's `walkProof`
  (`LeanFixpoint/Zap/Walk.lean`) — ∀↦λ, ∧↦`And.intro`, κ-free leaf↦residual
  mvar — differing only at the κ-head leaf, where Zap emits its strongest
  ∃-tree solution (`emitKLeaf`) and PA emits the survivor conjunction
  (`emitPALeaf`). No binder/guard bookkeeping is needed: each survivor
  conjunct is an atom proved by the ambient-context oracle `proveLeaf`.

/-- κ-head detector for the PA glue, analogous to `kHead?` but keyed by the PA
    assignment. If `goal` is `?κ a₁ … aₙ` for some κ recorded in `assign`,
    returns that κ, its surviving candidates, and the argument array. -/
def paHead?
    (assign : List (KVar × List (Expr × List Nat)))
    (goal : Expr) :
    Option (KVar × List (Expr × List Nat) × Array Expr) :=
  let fn := goal.getAppFn
  if fn.isMVar then
    (assign.find? (fun (κ, _) => κ.mvarId == fn.mvarId!)).map
      (fun (κ, survivors) => (κ, survivors, goal.getAppArgs))
  else none

/-- Fold `(conjunctType, proof)` pairs into one proof, mirroring `conjoinExprs`
    (`LeanFixpoint/PA/Weaken.lean`) EXACTLY: left-nested `And`, `[]` ↦
    `True.intro`, `[p]` ↦ `p`. The result inhabits
    `conjoinExprs (pairs.map (·.1))`, i.e. the β-reduced witness body
    `σ_{A*}(κ)(x̄)` assigned to the κ-mvar — so the κ-head leaf typechecks. -/

/-- Prove the survivor conjunction `⋀_{(q,ρ) ∈ survivors} q[ρ](args)` at a
    κ-head leaf. Each conjunct `q[ρ](args)` is built exactly as
    `specializeClauseForHead`'s headRepl (β-apply `q` at the chosen κ-slots) and
    discharged by the proof-returning oracle `proveLeaf` under the ambient
    context Γ; the proofs are then `And.intro`-folded in the SAME order and
    association as `conjoinExprs` (hence as the witness λ assigned to κ).

    Errors loudly if a survivor fails: at a true weakening fixpoint every
    survivor must re-prove, so a failure signals the glue oracle and the
    weakening oracle (`checkExprVC`) have diverged. -/

/-- The §5 `glue`. Walk the body `goal` (with cut κ-mvars still SYNTACTICALLY
    present — never `instantiateMVars` it), emitting the bridge proof term:

    · κ-head leaf `?κ x̄`   → `emitPALeaf` (survivor conjunction via oracle)
    · ∀ (binder or guard)  → intro fvar, recurse, λ-wrap
    · ∧                    → recurse both sides, `And.intro`
    · κ-free leaf          → fresh residual mvar (a query collected into `c′`)

    A κ-head whose κ is NOT in `assign` is a non-cut κ — abort and tell the user
    to eliminate acyclic κ's with `fusion` first. Once the cut κ-mvars are
    assigned `σ_{A*}`, the emitted term inhabits `c[σ_{A*}]`; together with the
    `Exists.intro` scaffolding from `peelExistentialsAndIntro` it is the §5
    `bridge`, which the kernel re-checks. -/
