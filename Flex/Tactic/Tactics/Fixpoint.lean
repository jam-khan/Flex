/-! ## `fixpoint` tactic

  Predicate abstraction for the *cyclic* κ's of a constraint — the second half
  of the solver, complementing `fusion` (which handles the acyclic κ's).

  Per the pipeline contract:
  - **assumes κ's as meta-vars** — peels the head ∃-chain into κ-mvars first, so
    it works directly on `∃ κ, P` goals (e.g. the residual `fusion` leaves);
  - **predicate abstraction** — seeds every cyclic κ with the union of all
    `@[qualif]`-tagged predicates and runs Houdini weakening to a fixpoint;
  - **existentials handled too** — the ∃-peeling means no manual `Exists.intro`
    is needed before calling it.

  Acyclic κ's are *not* solved here — run `fusion` first. Any acyclic κ still
  present (or any κ PA fails to solve) is surfaced as a user goal `⊢ T`. -/
