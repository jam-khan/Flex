  ## `pa_cert` — certifying Predicate Abstraction (paper §5)

  Cut-only certifier. Given `∃κ̄. c` whose ∃-bound κ's are all solved by
  predicate abstraction (e.g. `cyc0`, `FibFibFast` — the post-Zap residual),
  `pa_cert`:

  1. peels the ∃-chain into κ-mvars (`Exists.intro` scaffolding);
  2. runs the weakening fixpoint to `A*` (reused PA pipeline);
  3. assigns each κ-mvar its witness λ `σ_{A*}(κ)`;
  4. emits the §5 `glue`/`bridge` proof of the body via `walkPAProof`, where
     every κ-head leaf is discharged by an `And.intro` over per-survivor oracle
     proofs and every κ-free leaf becomes a residual goal `c′`.

  Unlike `solve_fixpoint`, the κ-heads are certified by structured proof terms
  the kernel re-checks (not thrown wholesale at `grind`), and the residual `c′`
  is LEFT as user goals rather than auto-closed. A non-cut (acyclic) κ-head
  aborts with a hint to run `fusion` first.
