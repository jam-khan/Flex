/-- Find a κ-param position that `binderFvar` *consistently* fills across all
    κ-applications in `body`.

    For each κ-app, collect the set of positions where `binderFvar` appears.
    Then the **universal positions** are those present in *every* κ-app's set.
    If any universal position exists, return the smallest. Otherwise, fall back
    to the last bare occurrence across all calls (legacy compatibility with the
    pre-mvar-migration `resolveScopeParam`).

    This tolerates binders that appear at multiple positions within a single
    κ-app (common in FluxRS-generated VCs where the same value is passed both
    as a base param and as a `.elems`/`.len` accessor target). The fallback is
    restricted to that single-κ-app case: with several κ-apps (e.g. a
    hypothesis-position use of κ alongside its actual defining/head-position
    clause), an outer binder can legitimately fill a slot at one occurrence
    and be absent — or differ — at another (the defining clause may use a
    *different* outer variable, like a loop's "next" state, at the same
    position). Folding the binder there is unsound: it silently rewrites that
    *other* occurrence's variable wherever it appears in σ̂ (including inside
    embedded guards unrelated to κ's own args), producing an ill-typed proof
    that only the kernel catches. So with multiple κ-apps, "no universal
    position" must leave the binder unfolded (`none`), not guess. -/
def findOuterBinderToParam (κ : KVar) (binderFvar : FVarId) (body : Expr) : Option Nat :=
  let kArgsList := collectKAppArgs κ body
  let perCall : List (List Nat) := kArgsList.map fun args =>

/-- Struct-projection analog of `findOuterBinderToParam`. When a struct-typed
    scope binder `x` reaches κ only through projections (`Foo.field x`), `x`
    itself never appears as a κ-argument, so `findOuterBinderToParam` returns
    `none` and the descent stalls at `x` (leaking `x` plus every binder below
    it as `∃`). This finds the `(projExpr, slot)` pairs where a projection of
    `x` fills a slot in EVERY κ-app, so those projections fold to κ-params and
    `x` can be dropped.

    A slot qualifies iff every κ-app carries the *same* expression there and
    that expression is an application whose final argument is exactly `.fvar x`
    (e.g. `@Foo.field _ _ x`). Returns `[]` when no projection is universal. -/

/-- Split κ-vars into (acyclic, cyclic). The acyclic list is topologically
    sorted so dependency sinks (no κ-deps) appear first — required so each
    κ's sol is built only after its dependencies have been eliminated.

    The cyclic set is a **feedback-vertex cut set** (the liquid-fixpoint
    "kuts"): the minimal-ish set of κ's whose removal makes the dependency
    graph acyclic (`classifyKVars`/`cutVarsIterative`). Every non-cut κ is then
    eliminated by fusion, matching hs-fixpoint — e.g. on `SimpleLoop`
    (`k0→k1`, `k1→k0`, `k0→k0`) the self-loop forces `k0` into the cut and `k1`
    is fused, instead of the old reachability rule ("cyclic = on any cycle")
    which sent the whole `{k0,k1}` SCC to PA. -/

/-- `exprSolScoped κ e` — strip the κ-free outer ∀-prefix and compute sol1
    on the inner `c'`, returning the paper's σ̂_body.

    Behavior per outer ∀:
    - **Type binder** `∀ x:T. body` — if `x` is consistently the i-th κ-arg,
      record `(x_fvar, zᵢ)` to be substituted in the final sol. Otherwise
      stop stripping and treat from this binder as part of `c'`.
    - **Prop binder** `∀ _:p. body` (implication antecedent) — drop `p` and
      descend (the hypothesis is in scope at every κ-use site, so the sol
      doesn't repeat it).
    - **κ-containing dom or non-∀** — `c'` starts here.

    *Substitution is deferred*: we walk through `withLocalDeclD` keeping REAL
    fvars in scope so that `exprSol1`'s `inferType`/`whnf` on sub-expressions
    succeed (synthetic `FVarId.mk "zᵢ"` would fail since they're not in the
    local context). Only AFTER sol1 builds the final sol do we substitute
    each recorded fvar with its synthetic κ-param fvar — that substitution
    is the analog of `solToWitnessExpr`'s param→fvar mapping. -/
