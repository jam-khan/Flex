# Evaluation: `solve_fixpoint` vs `fusion` + `solve_fixpoint`

Comparison over every example in `demo/basic.lean`, measuring heartbeats
(deterministic, `IO.getNumHeartbeats`/1000) and wall-clock ms
(`IO.monoMsNow`). Harness: `eval/BasicCompare.lean` (run with
`set_option Elab.async false` so tactic work is measured synchronously).

- **A** = `unfold; solve_fixpoint` — the integrated solver (old branch-stripping
  scope fusion + predicate abstraction + grind/aesop discharge).
- **B** = `unfold; fusion; all_goals solve_fixpoint` — new LCA-scoped `fusion`
  eliminates the acyclic κ structurally (certifying proof term), then
  `solve_fixpoint` discharges the (clean) residual.

- **Geometric-mean speedup (heartbeats): 4.1×** across 20 examples.
- Aggregate: 75983 → 9746 heartbeats (7.8× less), 2557 → 382 ms (6.7× less).
- Every example is faster with `fusion` first; the margin grows with κ-count /
  nesting depth (`ex_stress`, 5 κ: 14.8×; `ex12`/`ex14`, 4 κ: ~7–9×).

## Reading

`solve_fixpoint` leans on grind/aesop search to discharge clauses; the LCA-scoped
`fusion` replaces that search with a deterministic, kernel-checked structural
elimination of the acyclic κ, so the downstream grind has little or nothing left
to do. The clean scope (prefix binders/guards folded into κ-params instead of extra
`∃`/conjuncts) is what keeps the residual small enough for grind to close cheaply.

_Numbers are from one run on this machine; heartbeats are deterministic, ms are
indicative. Reproduce: `lake env lean eval/BasicCompare.lean`._
